Early-Stage Cancer Prediction ðŸ§¬
A machine learning project that predicts early-stage cervical cancer using patient data.

Features
Cleaned and preprocessed UCI cervical cancer dataset
Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
Trained 5 models: Random Forest, KNN, KMeans, Decision Tree, SVM
Evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, log loss, and confusion matrix
Dataset
This project uses the Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
